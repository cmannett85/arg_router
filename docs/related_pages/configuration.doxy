/** @page configuration Configuration
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * There are a few core parts of arg_router that are configurable as compile defines, most are
 * accessible globally (in a more C++ friendly way) in the @ref config namespace.  All are available
 * as CMake cache variables, minus the "AR_" prefix.
 * 
 * <TT>AR_MAX_CTS_SIZE</TT> when using C++17 or if <TT>AR_DISABLE_CPP20_STRINGS=true</TT> is the
 * maximum size an argument to <TT>S_</TT> can be, it defaults to 128.  Increasing the size won't
 * increase your program size, but will increase the build time.
 * 
 * <TT>AR_LONG_PREFIX</TT> is the character string that defines the prefix of <I>long</I>-form token
 * labels e.g. "--help".  It defaults to two hyphens. If redefining, this must have the same or more
 * characters than <TT>AR_SHORT_PREFIX</TT>.
 * 
 * <TT>AR_SHORT_PREFIX</TT> is the character string that defines the prefix of <I>short</I>-form
 * token labels e.g. "-h".  It defaults to one hyphen.  It must have one character in it.
 *
 * <TT>AR_UTF8_TRAILING_WINDOW_SIZE</TT> sets the Trailing window size for the grapheme cluster and
 * line break algorithms, defaults to 16.  Each entry in the trailing window is a break property of
 * a grapheme cluster ("user-perceived character"), not a byte.
 *
 * <TT>AR_DISABLE_CPP20_STRINGS</TT> is a boolean value that forcibly disables C++20 compile-time
 * string support when set to true.
